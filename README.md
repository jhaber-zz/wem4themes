# wem4themes
This repository contains code-in-progress for a generalized inductive method of generating domain-specific dictionaries through word embedding models (WEMs). Starting with a set of seed terms, this workflow has three steps: construct (query model and develop core dictionaries), refine (maximize dictionary coherence and distinctiveness), and validate (using unsupervised clustering and hand coding). 

I am optimizing the approach by varying the core dictionary size, WEM algorithm (word2vec, etc.), WEM generation method (pre-trained vs. native), and dictionary application method (count-based vs. vector projection). I am also comparing results from two test cases: charter schools data and a large corpus of journal articles. An optimized, publicly available method would allow researchers in diverse domains an accessible, reproducible, and valid workflow for both dictionary creation and assessing the validity of outside, researcher-generated themes in a text corpus. This represents a significant improvement on the idiosyncratic, domain-restrictive approach to dictionaries used by most social scientists for decades.
