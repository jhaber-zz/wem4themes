# wem4themes
This repository contains code to train word embedding models (WEMs) on large, rich text corpora and assess the validity of researcher-generated themes within the texts' discursive structures. The "queryable neural net" of WEMs is a powerful tool for iterative interpretation of semantic structures through the lens of broader themes--whether provided by previous research or outside social domains. I illustrate this application of WEMs through analysis of web-crawled self-descriptions of all 6,862 charter schools open in the 2015-16 school year.
